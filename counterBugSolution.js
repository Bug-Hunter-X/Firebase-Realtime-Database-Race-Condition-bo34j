The solution involves using Firebase's transaction functionality to ensure atomicity of data updates. This guarantees that only one client's update is applied at a time, preventing data loss or inconsistency.  The code below demonstrates how to solve the race condition using transactions:

```javascript
//Correct Implementation using transactions
firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(function(currentCount) {
  if (currentCount === null) {
    return 1; // Initialize counter if it's null
  } else {
    return currentCount + 1;
  }
});
```
By wrapping the counter update within a transaction, we ensure that the increment operation is performed atomically, guaranteeing data consistency even under concurrent access.
